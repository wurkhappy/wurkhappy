				<p><strong>How is Zipmark different from other payment services?</strong><br />
				Zipmark transactions are just like a check from your account, except without the paper or the trip to the bank for the depositor. What this means is that just like a check from your bank, with Zipmark you pay with your money and get paid directly in your account except without fees or delays.</p>

				<p>Some internet and mobile payment tools require you to &ldquo;load&rdquo; a payment account just to pay with your own money, and then charge fees and take 24 to 48 hours to get access to money paid. With Zipmark it is always your money in your bank account.</p>

				<p><strong>What do I need to send or receive money with Zipmark?</strong><br />
				Zipmark users must have:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>A checking account at a bank, credit union or thrift, which is in good standing.</li>

				<p><strong>What will I see in my bank account when I send money with Zipmark</strong><br />
				Zipmark payers will see the transaction in their online banking, personal finance site (Mint, Quicken, etc.) or even at the ATM. The record of the transaction will look and feel like you wrote a check from your account and will be accompanied by a check image that indicates who you paid through Zipmark. You can print the check and use it as a record of the transaction if you wish.</p>

				<p><strong>How is the information I give Zipmark secured?</strong><br />
				Zipmark uses electronic checks that are a financial industry standard and a safe and reliable way of processing payments. It uses technology that has been developed and tested to process your check information securely. Zipmark treats all user information with the same level of security and we never share any of your information with anyone.</p>

				<h2>Why did we start Wurk Happy?</h2>
				
				<p><strong>Main reason</strong><br />
				We believe freelancing should be easier.</p>

				<p><strong>What problems do we hope to solve?</strong><br />
				Wurk Happy aims to improve communication, reduce administration, and decrease payment processing times by providing a simple, fast, and transparent way for freelancers and clients to manage agreements anamake payment.</p>
				
				<h2>Vision</h2>
				<p>If you could redesign the way people work together, what where would you start? How would you ensure that relationships 	are fostered? That communication is honest? That we treat people better – because we can? … We’re starting with agreements, billing, and payments. </p>
				
				<p>We believe that the world is changing. And we hope that we can help change it for the better for the freelancing ecosystem. As more people work for themselves – by choice or by necessity – we aim to be the tool that helps them work well with each other so that their businesses run more smoothly and they have more potential.</p>
				
				<p>When you much through the crap – ceremony and pretense, you begin to realize that we’re all in this together.</p>
				
				<p>We believe that freelancers deserve a fair, dynamic system to work with their clients.</p>
				
				<p>We believe the future of work will be [distributed – link]. And we don’t think existing software solves the problems freelancers have in managing communication, administration, and payment around payment. We built Wurk Happy to be the solution for all freelancers.</p>
				
				<p>Many freelance by choice because no employment really compares to the satisfaction of working for yourself. Others are forced to freelance – they may have been fired from a job or can’t find work and are looking for ways to make ends meet. Either way, Wurk Happy was made for you. The way that people used to spend their whole lives working for the same company no longer exists.  Job security doesn’t exist anymore. You are a freelancers whether you identify with the term or not. Employees get outsourced, corporations cut costs while reaping large profits.</p>
				
				<p>As the labor force shifts, there is much pain in how freelancers and their clients operate together. This is a battle in which both the freelancer and the client are on the same side. With responsibilities get blurred, administration slips, and payments get delayed nobody wins. The freelance relationship becomes contentious when neither side ever wanted this. I believe that people want to be closer to those they work with and that maintaining this humanness in relationships has never been more important than in the way freelancers and their clients work together. Relationships are everything. They are the freelancers lifeblood. We want to make these business relationships better.</p>
				
				<p>It’s our goal to improve the payment experience for freelancers and their clients. </p>
				
				<p>A Better Ecosystem</p>

				<p><strong>How is Zipmark different from other payment services?</strong><br />
				Zipmark transactions are just like a check from your account, except without the paper or the trip to the bank for the depositor. What this means is that just like a check from your bank, with Zipmark you pay with your money and get paid directly in your account except without fees or delays.</p>

				<p>Some internet and mobile payment tools require you to "load" a payment account just to pay with your own money, and then charge fees and take 24 to 48 hours to get access to money paid. With Zipmark it is always your money in your bank account.</p>

				<p><strong>What do I need to send or receive money with Zipmark?</strong><br />
				Zipmark users must have:</p>

				<ul class="faq">
					<li>A checking account at a bank, credit union or thrift, which is in good standing.</li>

				Zipmark payers will see the transaction in their online banking, personal finance site (Mint, Quicken, etc.) or even at the ATM. The record of the transaction will look and feel like you wrote a check from your account and will be accompanied by a check image that indicates who you paid through Zipmark. You can print the check and use it as a record of the transaction if you wish.</p>
